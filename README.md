# places-frontend

Note: This is a personal project in which I show places I've been to or places I want to go in a map.

I've used this project as a reason to learn Angular2, so the code in this project might be a little shitty 'cause I'm an Angular2 newbie and I've taken baby steps 8-). I'll try to improve it as I learn more about Angular2.
